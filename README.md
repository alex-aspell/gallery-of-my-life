# gallery-of-my-life

## This is a gallery of at least 6 photos that are meaningful to me with a description of why. 

### To Do
    [x] Set up folders, packages, and dependencies
    [x] Add a database
    [x] Find picture and put it in project
    [x] Build html with AngularJS
    [x] Connect client.js to html
    [x] Display one photo on the DOM on initial page load
    [x] Create upvote and downvote buttons 
    [x] Create put that adds an upvote to specific picture on the database
    [x] Create put that downvotes (subtract 1) from the database
    [x] Make a get function that displays the number of votes from the database on the DOM
    [x] Add click function to picture
        * this ng-click should hide the picture and reveal the description
        * look into having an opaque description so the image can still be seen
    [ ] Repeat this for the rest of the photos
    [ ] Add bootstrap with the photos in rows of 3
